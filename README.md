# Automatic Chess Board with Arduino

## Overview

This project is an Automatic Chess Board that uses Arduino to interact with physical chess pieces on the board. The system can respond to player moves and make moves itself, creating a magical and interactive chess-playing experience.

## Features

- **Automatic Response:** The board can detect moves made by players and respond accordingly, creating a seamless chess-playing experience.
- **Arduino Integration:** Utilizes Arduino for hardware control, making it easy to set up and customize.
- **Player Interaction:** Players can interact with the physical board, and the system provides responses.
